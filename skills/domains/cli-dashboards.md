# CLI Dashboards and Terminal Reporting

Build data dashboards that run in the terminal. No web server, no browser, no polling loops until the design is locked.

## When to use

- User wants to see data without opening a browser
- User wants retro-futuristic / terminal-brutalist aesthetic
- Reporting on trades, metrics, or system state
- Quick iteration before committing to a web dashboard

## Principles

1. **Terminal-first, web later.** Start with `rich` tables in the terminal. Only graduate to Streamlit/Grafana after the data shape and report layout are validated.
2. **No polling until locked.** Do not add live refresh, WebSocket feeds, or cron polling until the static report design is approved. Polling on a broken dashboard just produces noise.
3. **Tufte minimal.** Sparklines inline. Tabular-nums for quantities. No decorative chart junk. 1px borders. Monospace. Let data speak.
4. **Simulated data for preview.** Seed the database with realistic mock data so the user sees the shape before live data arrives. Replace mock inserts with real inserts later — zero schema changes.
5. **Dual UI pattern.** Build a terminal report (`rich`) AND a static HTML companion simultaneously. The terminal is for quick CLI checks; the HTML is for staring at the shape and sharing screenshots. Both read from the same SQLite DB.

## Technique

### Stack
- `rich` (Python) — tables, colors, sparklines
- `sqlite3` (stdlib) — store and query
- `csv` (stdlib) — export for Excel/R/Python

### Pattern: flux_report.py shape

```python
# 1. Schema with agent_id for virtual partition
CREATE TABLE flux_trades (
    trade_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- "kilo" or "pamela" for per-agent attribution
    regime   TEXT NOT NULL,       -- e.g. trending_bull, neutral_range
    strategy TEXT NOT NULL,       -- e.g. PMCC, EBCP, 0DTE
    pnl_pct  REAL,
    ...
);

# 2. Seed function with realistic distributions per category
#    NOT uniform random — use Gaussian with regime-conditional means
#    Example: PMCC mean +3.8% σ=4.2, EBCP mean +2.4% σ=2.8
#    Add tail risk: Pareto left tail for strategies with known blow-up risk

# 3. Materialized regime matrix
#    GROUP BY agent_id, regime, strategy
#    Rebuild on demand with --rebuild flag

# 4. Render with rich.Table
#    box.MINIMAL_DOUBLE_HEAD, no heavy grid
#    Sparklines as Unicode blocks inline
#    Activity bars: relative volume per cell

# 5. CLI args
#    --agent     Filter by agent (virtual partition)
#    --month     Filter by YYYY-MM
#    --format    csv | terminal
#    --live      Show open positions (exit_date IS NULL)
#    --seed      (Re)populate simulated data
#    --rebuild   Recompute materialized matrix
```

### Dual UI: Terminal + HTML Companion

Build both at once. They share the same SQLite DB but serve different purposes:

| UI | Purpose | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal (`rich`) | Quick CLI checks, daily stand-ups, CSV export | You're in a shell |
| HTML (`file://`) | Staring at shape, sharing screenshots, mobile view | You want to look at data |

HTML styling: dark teal bg (`#0a1212`), monospace, 1px borders, electric cyan (`#00E5FF`) for gains, coral red (`#FF6B6B`) for losses. No frameworks — pure CSS + tables.

### Color palette (terminal-brutalist)
- Headers: `#B4B4B4` (dim white)
- Gains / positive: `#00E5FF` (electric cyan)
- Losses / negative: `#FF6B6B` (coral red)
- Borders: `#333333` (dark gray)
- Activity bars fill: `#555555`, empty: `#2591`

### Sparklines
Use Unicode block elements: `\u2581\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588`
- Sample down to target width
- Scale to [min, max] of series
- Inline after numeric summary, not in separate panel

## Anti-patterns

- **Building monitoring before the system works.** Do not create alerting, live dashboards, or cron polling before the underlying pipeline generates real data. Monitoring a broken system produces noise, not signal. See `07-SENTRY/README.md` deferred placeholder pattern.
- **Over-explaining the dashboard.** Show the rendered output first. Explain only if asked. The user wants to see data, not read a design document.
- **Web stack for v0.** No Flask, Streamlit, or React for the first iteration. Terminal is faster to iterate and matches the user's CRT-phosphor aesthetic preference.
- **Hard-coding `python` on macOS.** Always use `python3` — the `python` binary is often missing on macOS even when Python 3 is installed.
- **Uniform random simulated data.** Do not seed with uniform or iid Gaussian. Use regime-conditional distributions: different mean/σ per category, Pareto left tails for known blow-up risks, and Markov-chain regime persistence (today's regime predicts tomorrow's). Otherwise the dashboard looks impressive but produces nonsense for capital allocation.

## Desktop Packaging with Electron

When the dashboard design is locked and the user wants a native app (dock icon, menu bar, no browser tab), package the HTML dashboard as a cross-platform Electron app.

### When to package

- User wants the dashboard in the dock / menu bar, not a localhost URL
- Real-time data visualization with rich visuals and customizable themes
- Cross-platform distribution (.dmg, .exe, .AppImage)
- Embedded data proxy so no separate Python server is needed

### Architecture

```
Electron (main.js)
  ├── Embedded HTTP proxy (Node http.createServer)
  │   ├── / → index.html (dashboard)
  │   ├── /theme-builder.html → theme editor
  │   └── /api/* → proxied to backend
  ├── BrowserWindow (frameless or hiddenInset)
  └── Tray icon with context menu
```

### Workflow

1. **Build the HTML dashboard first** — Ensure it works standalone with `fetch('/api/...')`
2. **Move colors to CSS custom properties** — Use `data-theme` attributes on `<html>` for instant theme switching
3. **Add a theme builder (optional)** — Color pickers + live iframe preview via `postMessage`
4. **Write `main.js`** — `http.createServer` for embedded proxy, `BrowserWindow` with `titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`
5. **Configure `package.json`** — `electron-builder` targets for mac (dmg+zip), win (nsis+portable), linux (AppImage+deb)
6. **Generate icon** — Python PIL script if no designer asset available (see `references/electron-icon-generation.md`)
7. **Build & release** — `npx electron-builder --mac --win --linux`, then `gh release create`

### Theme system

All visual differences are CSS variables (`--bg`, `--cyan`, `--red`, etc.). Switch with:

```javascript
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', name);
localStorage.setItem('theme', name);
```

Six complete skins are documented in `references/electron-theme-system.md` (Phosphor, Cyberpunk, Military, Amber, Matrix, Minimal).

### CRT effects (optional atmosphere)

Pure CSS `pointer-events: none` overlays:
- **Scanlines** — `body::before` with `repeating-linear-gradient`
- **Vignette** — `body::after` with `radial-gradient`
- **Glow text** — `text-shadow` scaled by `--glow-intensity` variable
- **Flicker** — `@keyframes flicker` on borders or live indicators

See `references/electron-crt-effects.md` for full CSS snippets.

### Anti-patterns

- **Don't** build a separate backend server — embed the proxy in `main.js`
- **Don't** use `Math.random()` for decorative waveforms — compute real deltas from poll history
- **Don't** make the whole page scroll — each panel scrolls independently with `overflow-y: auto`
- **Don't** use rounded cards or Inter font for terminal-brutalist aesthetic — monospace + 1px borders + sharp corners

## Templates

- `templates/flux_report.py` — Starter dashboard with rich + sqlite + sparklines + CSV export. Copy and modify for any domain.
- `templates/electron-main.js` — Electron main process with embedded proxy + tray + window
- `templates/electron-preload.js` — Secure IPC bridge (contextIsolation)
- `templates/electron-theme-system.css` — Complete 6-skin theme stylesheet with CRT effects, glow scaling, switcher UI
