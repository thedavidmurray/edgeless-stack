# Academic Research — 13-Agent Deep Research Pipeline

Ported from ARS v2.9.3 to Hermes skill format. Universal deep research for any discipline.

## Quick Start

```
research the impact of AI on higher education QA
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='socratic')  # Guided thinking
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='full')        # Complete research report
```

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Description | Output |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `full` | "research", "deep research" | Complete 6-phase pipeline | APA 7.0 research report |
| `socratic` | "guide my research", "help me think" | Guided research dialogue | INSIGHT collection |
| `quick` | "quick brief", "30 min research" | Fast research summary | Executive summary |
| `lit-review` | "literature review" | Literature synthesis only | Annotated bibliography |
| `fact-check` | "fact-check", "verify" | Source verification | Verification report |
| `systematic-review` | "systematic review", "PRISMA" | PRISMA-compliant review | Full SR report |
| `review` | "review this paper" | Paper evaluation | Assessment report |

## 13-Agent Pipeline

| # | Agent | Phase | Role |
|---|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | `research_question_agent` | 1/Socratic L1 | FINER-scoped RQ formulation |
| 2 | `research_architect_agent` | 1 | Methodology blueprint |
| 3 | `bibliography_agent` | 2 | Systematic literature search |
| 4 | `source_verification_agent` | 2 | Fact-checking, source grading |

| 7 | `editor_in_chief_agent` | 5 | Q1 journal editorial review |
| 8 | `devils_advocate_agent` | 1,3,5,Socratic | Challenge assumptions |
| 9 | `ethics_review_agent` | 5 | AI-assisted research ethics |
| 10 | `socratic_mentor_agent` | Socratic | Q1 editor persona guidance |
| 11 | `risk_of_bias_agent` | SR Phase 2 | RoB 2 / ROBINS-I assessment |
| 12 | `meta_analysis_agent` | SR Phase 3 | Effect sizes, heterogeneity |
| 13 | `monitoring_agent` | Post-pipeline | Literature monitoring |

## Orchestration: 6-Phase Workflow

```
Phase 1: SCOPING       -> research_question + research_architect -> RQ Brief + Methodology Blueprint
Phase 2: INVESTIGATION  -> bibliography + source_verification      -> Annotated Bibliography + Verified Corpus
Phase 3: ANALYSIS       -> synthesis_agent (+ devil's advocate)   -> Synthesis Report + Gap Analysis
Phase 4: COMPOSITION    -> report_compiler_agent                   -> Draft APA 7.0 Report
Phase 5: REVIEW         -> editor_in_chief + devil's + ethics      -> Review Verdict + Ethics Clearance
Phase 6: REVISION       -> report_compiler_agent                   -> Final Polished Report
```

## Mode Selection Guide

```
User Input
    |
    +-- Clear research question?
    |   +-- Yes --> Need PRISMA systematic review?
    |   |           +-- Yes --> systematic-review mode
    |   |           +-- No --> Need full report?
    |   |                      +-- Yes --> full mode
    |   |                      +-- No --> Only literature?
    |   |                                 +-- Yes --> lit-review
    |   |                                 +-- No --> quick mode
    |   +-- No --> Want guidance?
    |              +-- Yes --> socratic mode
    |              +-- No --> full mode (Phase 1 interactive)
    +-- Text to review? --> review mode
    +-- Fact-check only? --> fact-check mode
```

## Integration with arxiv Skill

```python
# Literature search
# Uses arxiv skill patterns + Semantic Scholar API
# See arxiv skill for: search_arxiv.py, SS citation queries

# Search pattern
curl "https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:TOPIC&max_results=20"
curl "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=TOPIC&limit=20"
```

## Anti-Leakage Protocol

Activate when user provides RQ Brief + Synthesis Report + Annotated Bibliography AND mode is `full`:

1. **Knowledge Isolation Directive**: LLM must not hallucinate beyond provided sources
2. **Two-Layer Citation Emission**: Inline citations + full reference list
3. **Source Anchoring**: Every claim tied to verified source
4. **Gap Flagging**: Explicitly mark where evidence is insufficient

## Source Quality Hierarchy

| Tier | Type | Trust Level |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Systematic reviews, meta-analyses | Highest |
| 2 | RCTs, well-controlled studies | High |
| 3 | Cohort/case-control studies | Moderate |
| 4 | Expert opinion, editorials | Low |
| 5 | Unverified sources | Reject |

## Socratic Mode: 5 Layers

| Layer | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Research Readiness | RQ refinement |
| 2 | Architecture Design | Methodology |
| 3 | Literature Landscape | Source mapping |
| 4 | Analysis Strategy | Approach |
| 5 | Synthesis Plan | Report structure |

**Convergence signals** (4 types):
- Aha moments, specificity jumps, resistance collapse, forward reference

## Systematic Review Mode (PRISMA)

Additional agents activated:
- `risk_of_bias_agent`: RoB 2 (RCTs), ROBINS-I (non-randomized)
- `meta_analysis_agent`: Effect sizes, heterogeneity (I²), GRADE

PRISMA checklist compliance for:
- Protocol registration
- Search strategy documentation
- Dual screening
- Risk of bias assessment
- Narrative or quantitative synthesis

## Fact-Check Mode

1. Source verification hierarchy
2. Predatory journal detection
3. Conflict-of-interest flagging
4. Evidence quality grading
5. Cross-reference validation

## Citation Integration

Two-layer emission:
1. **Inline citations**: Narrative (Smith, 2024) or parenthetical
2. **Reference list**: Full APA 7.0 entries

## Usage Examples

```python
# Full research report
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='full', topic="AI in higher education QA")

# Socratic guidance
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='socratic', topic="declining birth rates + private universities")

# Systematic review
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='systematic-review', 
           research_question="What is the effect of X on Y?")

# Fact-check specific claims
skill_view(name='academic-research', mode='fact-check', 
           claims=["Claim 1", "Claim 2"])
```

## Subagent Delegation Pattern

```python
# Phase 1: RQ formation
delegate_task(
    goal="Transform vague topic into FINER-scoped research question",
    context={"topic": "...", "mode": "full"},
    toolsets=["web"]
)

# Phase 2: Literature search
delegate_task(
    goal="Conduct systematic literature search with source screening",
    context={"rq": "...", "methodology": "..."},
    toolsets=["web", "arxiv"]  # arxiv skill loaded
)

# Phase 3: Synthesis
delegate_task(
    goal="Cross-source integration, contradiction resolution, gap analysis",
    context={"bibliography": [...], "sources": [...]},
    toolsets=["file"]
)
```
