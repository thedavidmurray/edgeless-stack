# Vault Knowledge Operations

## Identity

A vault steward who keeps the knowledge surface organized, enriched, and self-healing. Operates across three layers:
1. **Structure** — canonical paths, numbered folders, collision detection, migration
2. **Enrichment** — multi-track semantic classification, routing, quality scoring
3. **Synthesis** — automated MOC generation, contradiction detection, scheduled compilation

## When to Use

- User mentions wrong vault location, taxonomy collision, or numbered-folder conflict
- Incoming content (YouTube, RSS, podcasts) needs classification and routing to specialist tracks
- Vault structure has drifted and needs remediation
- Building or maintaining an automated compilation agent that generates MOCs and detects stale links
- Deciding where generated media artifacts (renders, screenshots, build output) should be written

## When NOT to Use

- Search-only vault queries → use `search_files` or `session_search`
- One-off note creation → just write the file
- Full database administration → use ChromaDB-specific tools

## Vault Taxonomy Enforcement

Enforce the single source of truth per TAXONOMY.md v3.

### Canonical Locations

| Location | Canonical Path | Wrong Path (BLOCKED) |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Vault | `~/claude-projects/claude-vault/` | `~/claude-vault/` ❌ |
| Projects | `~/claude-projects/projects/` | `~/Projects/` ❌ |
| Backlog | `~/claude-projects/backlog/` | `*/backlog/tasks/` ❌ |
| Config | `~/.claude/`, `~/config/` | `*/05-config/` ❌ |

### Numbered Folders (v3)

| # | Folder | Purpose |
|---|--------|---------|
| 00 | 00-Inbox | Quick capture |
| 01 | 01-Journal | Daily notes |
| 02 | 02-Agents | Agent personas |
| 03 | 03-Knowledge | Research/KB |
| 04 | 04-Sessions | Session logs |
| 05 | 05-Solutions | Problem-solution |
| 06 | 06-Config | Configuration |
| 07 | 07-Business | Business strategy |
| 08 | 08-Reference | External refs |
| 09 | 09-Secrets | Credentials |
| 10 | 10-Meta | Meta-docs |
| 11 | 11-Databases | Bases/Chroma |
| 13 | 13-Reports | All reports |
| 14 | 14-Knowledge-Bases | Structured KB |
| 15 | 15-Products | Product docs |
| 16 | 16-Projects | Project docs |
| 17 | 17-Websites | Website builds |
| 99 | 99-Archive | Cold storage |

### Collision Detection & Migration

Run the taxonomy validator:
```bash
python3 .claude/hooks/validate-taxonomy.py --check
```

When migrating content from wrong locations:
1. Analyze the wrong location — count items, check for `.git/` dirs
2. Identify conflicts — compare file sizes/content hashes
3. Move files to canonical paths (use `shutil.move` for `.git/` preservation)
4. Remove empty directories
5. Add protection patterns to `~/.claude/hooks/patterns.yaml`

### Generated Media Artifacts — Where Renders Go

Never default to `~/Desktop/`. Route through canonical taxonomy:

| Artifact Type | Canonical Workspace | Example |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Video renders, loops | `~/claude-projects/generated/` | `generated/warning-icon-loop-30s.mp4` |
| Screenshots | `~/claude-projects/captures/` | `captures/touchdesigner-preview.png` |
| General build output | `~/claude-projects/output/` | `output/newsletter_digest.html` |
| HTML artifacts, mockups | `~/claude-projects/generated/` or project subdir | `generated/hermes-design-system/` |

Decision flow: transient render → `generated/`; durable knowledge → `claude-vault/<folder>/`; source code → `projects/`.

## Agent Memory Tiering & Offload

The agent's MEMORY.md is a 20,000-character HOT tier injected into every turn. Treating it as the only storage causes capacity crises and forces silent truncation of new facts. Route knowledge across three tiers:

| Tier | Storage | Capacity | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **HOT** | MEMORY.md | 20K chars | Active blockers, auth status, provider health, recent decisions |
| **WARM** | ChromaDB | 6,300+ docs, 22 collections | Semantic search: KB articles, specs, patterns, debug solutions |
| **COLD** | Obsidian Vault | 2.6GB, 5,100+ files | Canonical long-form: reports, archived projects, SOPs, incident detail |

### Offload Triggers

Offload from MEMORY.md when any of these are true:
- **Capacity >90%** — headroom drops below 2,000 chars
- **Staleness** — completed/resolved entries older than 7 days
- **Wrong tier** — detailed incident reports, migration logs, behavior patterns belong in COLD
- **Duplication** — same pattern described in 2+ entries (consolidate to single vault page)
- **Reference weight** — primarily pointers to stable paths (keep pointer, move detail)

### Offload Workflow

1. **Identify candidates** — scan MEMORY.md for longest/stale entries matching triggers
2. **Write vault pages** — create markdown with YAML frontmatter under `03-Knowledge/<topic>/`
3. **Create index** — if 3+ related pages, write `index.md` in the subdirectory
4. **Replace with pointers** — replace heavy entry in MEMORY.md with <150 char vault reference
5. **Update meta-entry** — keep a MEMORY.md entry documenting the 3-tier architecture and vault index location

### Canonical Offload Directories

| Topic | Vault Path |
|-------|-----------|
| Agent behavior patterns | `03-Knowledge/Agent-Infrastructure/hive-memory-offload/` |
| Infrastructure incidents | `03-Knowledge/Agent-Infrastructure/` |
| Trading system details | `03-Knowledge/Trading/Pamela/` |
| Discord / swarm ops | `03-Knowledge/Agent-Infrastructure/` |
| Design system specs | `03-Knowledge/Design/` |

See full pattern documentation: `references/agent-memory/3-tier-offload-pattern.md`

## Multi-Track Content Enrichment

Classify incoming content into semantic tracks, each triggering distinct downstream workflows.

### The 7 Standard Tracks

| Track | Purpose | Downstream Agent |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **knowledge** | General learning & synthesis | Scribe |
| **tool_workflow** | Tool evaluation & installation | Kilo/Beau |
| **people** | Network building & collaboration | Curator |
| **trading_intel** | Market signals & predictions | Pamela |
| **creative_seeds** | Generative art techniques | Critic/Specimen |
| **code_patterns** | Reusable code snippets | Kilo |
| **opportunity** | Business/product ideas | Builder |

### Enrichment Schema

Every enriched note carries:
```yaml
enrichment_tier: 3            # 0-3 scale
track_tags: [knowledge, tool_workflow]
context: "Why this matters to you"
one_liner: "Tweet-length summary"
vault_connections: [[Related-1]], [[Related-2]]
```

Score = universal_fields (max 5) + populated_track_payloads (1 each).

### Bulk Enrichment Pattern

For 100+ notes, use keyword-based assignment instead of transcript fetching:

```python
TRACK_KEYWORDS = {
    "tool_workflow": ["claude code", "cargo", "npm", "docker", "uv"],
    "creative_seeds": ["touchdesigner", "shader", "generative", "p5.js"],
    "trading_intel": ["polymarket", "prediction", "market"],
    "code_patterns": ["rust", "pattern", "idiomatic"],
    "opportunity": ["startup", "gap", "someone should"],
}

def assign_tracks_by_keywords(channel, title):
    text = f"{channel} {title}".lower()
    tracks = ["knowledge"]
    for track, keywords in TRACK_KEYWORDS.items():
        if any(kw in text for kw in keywords):
            tracks.append(track)
    return list(set(tracks))
```

This pattern enriched 154 notes in <1 second vs. 30+ minutes for transcript-based detection.

### ChromaDB Integration

Track assignment feeds into semantic clustering:
- Notes cluster by content similarity within tracks
- Emergent clusters suggest new track creation
- Cross-track connections discovered via embedding similarity

## Automated Vault Synthesis

Run scheduled compilation agents that cross-reference ChromaDB + vault markdown to detect drift, generate MOCs, and surface contradictions.

### What the Agent Does

1. **Queries ChromaDB** — pulls recent embeddings from domain-relevant collections
2. **Scans vault markdown** — finds files matching knowledge domain keywords
3. **Detects contradictions** — duplicate folders (`OnChain-Art` vs `On-Chain-Art`), stale wiki links
4. **Generates MOC pages** — Map of Content per domain with cross-references and source inventory
5. **Writes idempotently** — content-hash deduplication prevents duplicate writes

### Running the Agent

```bash
# Dry run (safe default)
DRY_RUN=1 python scripts/vault-compilation-agent.py

# Apply writes (only when preview looks correct)
APPLY=1 python scripts/vault-compilation-agent.py
```

### Blog-Topic Miner Variant

A specialized compilation agent that mines blog topics instead of MOCs. It cross-pollinates two ChromaDB collections from different semantic domains, uses an LLM to find the strongest conceptual bridge, and emits a structured blog framework (TITLE / THESIS / HOOK / SECTIONS / SOURCES / ANGLE). See `references/overnight-blog-topic-miner.md` for the miner design and `references/blog-content-pipeline.md` for the full 6-stage pipeline (drafts → autoreason → council → prep → publish).

### Cron Schedule

```cron
# Weekly synthesis — Sundays at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 cd ~/claude-projects && DRY_RUN=1 python scripts/vault-compilation-agent.py

# Monthly full apply — first Sunday
0 3 1-7 * 0 cd ~/claude-projects && APPLY=1 python scripts/vault-compilation-agent.py
```

## Pitfalls

- **Path resolution bug**: Use `PROJECT_ROOT / "claude-vault"`, NOT `Path.home() / "claude-vault"`.
- **Double-nesting bug**: Use `PROJECT_ROOT / "claude-vault" / "03-Knowledge"`, NOT `Path("~/claude-vault") / "claude-vault" / "03-Knowledge"`.
- **youtube-transcript-api v1.0.0+**: Uses `.text` attribute, NOT `["text"]` dict access.
- **Bulk enrichment speed**: Reserve transcript analysis for Tier-3 enrichment only; use keyword assignment for large batches.
- **Hash consistency bug**: When computing content hashes for idempotent writes, the verification must use exactly the same input as the generation step. Store the hash-computation expression in a variable and reuse it.
- **ChromaDB v2 JSON control characters**: The v2 API returns raw control characters in collection metadata. Strip ASCII 0-31 (except tab/newline/CR) before `json.loads`. See `references/chromadb-v2-api-patterns.md`.
- **ChromaDB v2 count endpoint returns raw integer**: Parse with `int(r.text)`, NOT `r.json()["count"]`.
- **LLM reasoning contamination in generation**: Reasoning models (Kimi K2.5, Claude, o3) leak chain-of-thought into content generation output. Always post-process with `clean_improved_draft()` to strip trailing "Wait," "Let me," and "Actually," paragraphs. See `references/llm-output-cleaning.md`.
- **Reasoning-model JSON null-content bug**: DeepSeek V4 Flash and similar reasoning-first models may return `content: null` with the actual JSON embedded in a separate `reasoning` field. Fall back to `msg.get('reasoning')` when `content` is None, then parse JSON from that text. See `references/content-enrichment/api-resilience-batch-enrichment.md`.
- **Batch inference API flakiness**: The Nous Research inference API (`inference-api.nousresearch.com`) returns 401s and timeouts under sustained load for `deepseek-v4-flash:free` even though single requests succeed. Do not rely on it for batch enrichment without exponential-backoff retry logic and a provider fallback. See `references/content-enrichment/api-resilience-batch-enrichment.md`.
- **Autoreason skip auto re-score**: Re-scoring a draft with the same model that just improved it produces bogus results (either hallucinated low scores from parsing reasoning text, or inflated self-approval). Skip automatic re-score; let the next stage (council or different model) verify.
- **Desktop default anti-pattern**: Never write media artifacts to `~/Desktop/` without explicit user instruction.

## Frontmatter Schema Convergence

The vault has 3-4 coexisting frontmatter schemas (YouTube enrichment, Books, split schema v2.0, wiki provisional). When extending schema, follow this order:

1. **Audit existing** — scan current schema files (`_system/FRONTMATTER-SCHEMA.md`, wiki `CLAUDE.md`, YouTube note template)
2. **Reconcile before adding** — map proposed fields to existing fields; avoid aliases
3. **Add only high-ROI fields** — `confidence` and `contested` are useful; `contradictions` arrays and `sources` arrays are bookkeeping overhead
4. **Update canonical schema doc** — patch `_system/FRONTMATTER-SCHEMA.md`, not a new file
5. **Backfill optional** — don't require new fields on existing notes; let them accumulate organically

Example safe addition (session 2026-05-21):
```yaml
# Added to FRONTMATTER-SCHEMA.md v2.0+
confidence: high    # well-supported across multiple sources
contested: true     # unresolved contradictions exist; see related notes
```

Anti-pattern: Adding `type: entity|concept|comparison` when `note_type` already exists. Adding `sources:` array when `source_url` + `related:` wikilinks cover 90% of use cases.
